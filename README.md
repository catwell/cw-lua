# Catwell's Lua playground

This repository is used to store the various Open Source tools,
algorithms and libraries I write in Lua (or rather LuaJIT + FFI)
that do not deserve their own repository.

These are mostly unmaintained prototypes and ideas I gave up on.
Projects I become more serious about graduate to their own repositories,
and sometimes projects that I stop maintaining end up here.
