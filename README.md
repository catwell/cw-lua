# iris-lua

## Presentation

A client for the [Iris](http://iris.karalabe.com/) relay protocol
[v0.1-draft2](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/10435909/Iris/relay.pdf).

## Warning

This has not been used in a real system yet. If you want to give it a try,
please do, but proceed with caution and report bugs you find.

## Dependencies

The client itself only depends on LuaSocket.

You will need [cwtest](https://github.com/catwell/cwtest) to run the test suite.

## Usage

Have a look at the `examples` directory and at `iris.test.lua`.

Documentation for Iris itself can be found on
[the official website](http://iris.karalabe.com/).
