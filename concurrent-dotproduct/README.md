# concurrent dot product

## Description

This is an example of how to compute a dot product using ConcurrentLua.

To try it:

- run `clpmd`,
- run the workers with `lua worker.lua $(hostname) node_name`,
- run the master code.

Be aware that this is an example and there is no error handling!

## Note

This is quite old code, so: not my current Lua style,
and it only works with Lua 5.1.
